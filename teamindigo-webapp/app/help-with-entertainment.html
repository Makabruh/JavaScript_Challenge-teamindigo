        <h3>TV Licenses:</h3>
        <p>
          TV Licenses are becoming less popular every year. You might not need one and the rules can sometimes be unclear.

          See these resources about people moving away from TV licenses and why.

        <h3>Gym Memberships:</h3>

          <br>
          See these comparison sites but also consider finding new, cheaper ways to exercise.
